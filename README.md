<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Petr üê≥</a> 

<h4>
I'm a software engineer. At the moment I am developing in Java. I am currently taking my master's degree in Web-oriented information systems development and also have a bachelor's degree in information security from VSU.

I like things to be organized, sorted and put in their proper places, so I also divided my github repositories into different organizations (there are no folders on github, so I had to create organizations).
<p>
In <a href='https://github.com/Explrorer-folder'>Explrorer-folder</a> are repositories of projects that I created during in-depth study of certain technologies/frameworks.
</p>
<p>
In <a href='https://github.com/Specific-features-folder'>Specific-features-folder</a> repositories of projects that I created to solve a particular problem/challenge and keep the wisdom of this solution for myself and not only in the future :)
