<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Petr üê≥</a> 

<h4>
I'm a software engineer. At the moment I am developing in Java.
</h4>
<h4>
I like things to be organized, sorted and put in their proper places, so I also divided my github repositories into different organizations (there are no folders on github, so I had to create organizations).<br>In <a href='https://github.com/Explrorer-folder'>Explrorer-folder</a> are repositories of projects that I created during in-depth study of certain technologies/frameworks.<br>In <a href='https://github.com/Specific-features-folder'>Specific-features-folder</a> repositories of projects that I created to solve a particular problem/challenge and keep the solution for myself and others in the future :)<br>The regular repositories contain repositories of my other projects that do not belong to these two groups. In them I have developed steganographic and cryptographic libraries with basic information hiding/encryption methods, my bachelor project with implementation of an application to support the mandate model of security in relational DBMSs and other projects.

I am currently taking my master's degree in web-oriented information systems development and also have a bachelor's degree in information security from VSU.
